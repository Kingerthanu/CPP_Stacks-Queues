# CPP_Stacks-Queues
  Personally created Stack and Queue data structures with random unit testing.

Assignment taught me a lot about the need for queues and stacks and the (member/trait)-based way of looking at object development as it helped me break down the creation of a stack and queue and track where and how data is stored and where as well as how to properly manage this in order to not lose data or get undefined behaivor. It Also Gave Me Better Debugging Skills As Having Dynamic Memory Caused Me To Learn Proper Ownership.

**The Breakdown:**
 
This Program Works To Fully Develop A Queue And Stack Object Based Upon Their ADTs. Allowing The User To Use The Terminal To Interface With It As Well As See Results. 

The Stack Includes Generic Insertions, Removals, And Searches With Proper Ownership And Behaivor For Its ADT.

The Queue Includes Generic Insertions, Removals, And Searches With Proper Ownership And Behaivor For Its ADT.

We Also Have The Ability To Reverse Either Of These Object Types.

In Our Unit Tests We Thoroughly Check For Leaks Of These Data Structures Using Random Number Generation To Ensure Well Rounded Behaivor For All Extremes.
