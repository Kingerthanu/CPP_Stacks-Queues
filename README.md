# CPP_Stacks-Queues
  Personally created Stack and Queue data structures with random unit testing. Assignment taught me a lot about the need for queues and stacks and the trait-based way of looking at object development as it helped me break down the creation of a stack and queue and track where and how data is stored and where as well as how to properly manage this in order to not lose data or get undefined behaivor.
